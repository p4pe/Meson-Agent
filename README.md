# Meson-Agent
The Meson Agent is responsible for the seamless and correct interconnection of the MESON components, as it operates as a central node, which processes and conveys required information. The messages are transmitted via REST calls. In addition, the Agent provides the required interface to slice tenants interested in CSC.
